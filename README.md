## About
EasyTeX converts user input text to LaTeX code and generates a live PDF Preview for the same. Leveraging LLMs like ChatGPT to facilitate easier onboarding of newcomers to LaTeX, by developing an intuitive web application that works on natural language and image input and generates the desired LaTeX styling.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
